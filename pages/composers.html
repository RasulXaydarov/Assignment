                    written in 1971. It was first used in the film Maddalena (1971),
                    later in the films Le Professionnel directed by Georges Lautner
                    (1981), as well as in the television series An Englishman's Castle
                    (1978). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Mai" target="_blank">Click here to see more

                    Lonely
                    Shepherd", also known as Einsamer Hirte or Der einsame Hirte in
                    German or as El pastor solitario in Spanish, is an instrumental
                    piece by James Last, first released in a recording with the Romanian
                    panflutist Gheorghe Zamfir. <br /><br />"The Lonely Shepherd" has
                    repeatedly been used as a soundtrack. In 1979, it was used as the
                    title theme for the six-part television series Golden Soak (Das Gold
                    der WÃ¼ste). In 1983 it was used as the love theme of a Venezuelan
                    series called Chao, Cristina produced by the Venezuelan TV network
                    RCTV and again in 1984 in the Oscar-nominated animated short film
                    Paradise. In 2003, Quentin Tarantino used the recording as
                    soundtrack in a scene and in the closing credits of his film Kill
                    Bill: Volume 1. On the DVD, Gheorghe Zamfir is mistakenly credited
                    as the title's producer.
