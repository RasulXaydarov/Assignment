"Chi Mai" (Italian: whoever) is a composition by Ennio Morricone written in 1971. It was first used in the film Maddalena (1971), later in the films Le Professionnel directed by Georges Lautner (1981), as well as in the television series An Englishman's Castle (1978).

///////////////////
"The Lonely Shepherd", also known as Einsamer Hirte or Der einsame Hirte in German or as El pastor solitario in Spanish, is an instrumental piece by James Last, first released in a recording with the Romanian panflutist Gheorghe Zamfir. 



The Lonely Shepherd" has repeatedly been used as a soundtrack. In 1979, it was used as the title theme for the six-part television series Golden Soak (Das Gold der WÃ¼ste). In 1983 it was used as the love theme of a Venezuelan series called Chao, Cristina produced by the Venezuelan TV network RCTV and again in 1984 in the Oscar-nominated animated short film Paradise. In 2003, Quentin Tarantino used the recording as soundtrack in a scene and in the closing credits of his film Kill Bill: Volume 1. On the DVD, Gheorghe Zamfir is mistakenly credited as the title's producer.
